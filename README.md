## 🚀 Features

- 🛡️ **Privacy-Driven Development**  
  Zero telemetry. No profiling. All local. Every request scrutinized, every connection transparent.

- 🧠 **Built for Deep Research**  
  Tab grouping, multi-window workflows, distraction-free modes — reimagining what browsers should do for thinkers. Bring pc features to mobile as a side quest. 

- ✨ **Minimal UI, Maximal Clarity**  
  Focus-oriented ui with immersive layouts and plenty of tools. Great anywhere, excellent on the go.

- 🌌 **Digital Future Design Language**  
  Designed with a vision of a future with augmented reality in full integration of our real world.

- 🧭 **Ethical Codebase**  
  Source-available, human-readable, and built without corporate surveillance hooks. Code with a conscience. No nonsense. I don't care for user data. 0 Data Abuse.

- 💰**What about financials?** 

    I want the funds to come from sponsors who are ethical. They won't care for user data neither. The truth? Yea, I definitely want to make money doing this. A whole lot of it. Enough to fund the best privacy suite there is and put a smile on my family's face every single day.

## 🌍 Philosophy

> _“The browser should serve the user — not exploit them.”_

Moonala is more than a browser. It's an ideal chaser— towards tools that empower rather than extract. Your attention is precious.

Moonala respects that.
